## 👋 About Me

Hello! I'm Aleksandra, a fervent fan of programming who enjoys learning and making things. I'm currently delving deeply into programming, concentrating on C# and Powershell. Making a video game that makes people happy is my dream.

ConcernedApe, the lone developer of Stardew Valley, is one of my greatest inspirations.
His commitment and creativity serve as a reminder to me that one person can create an entire world, pixel by pixel, with perseverance and heart.
