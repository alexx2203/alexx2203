👋 About Me

Hey there. I'm Aleksandra, currently surviving the wild realm of programming with C# and PowerShell as my chosen weapons.
I’m not pretending to be a 10x developer — I’m just stubborn enough not to give up when my code decides to go rogue.

My ultimate goal? To build a video game that doesn’t crash (too often).

ConcernedApe and Swen Vincke are my greatest inspirations.
ConcernedApe showed me that one person can build an entire world alone through passion and perseverance.
Swen Vincke reminds me that true dedication and love for games can move not only mountains, 
but entire teams toward something extraordinary.
