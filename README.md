👋 About Me

Hey there. I'm Aleksandra, currently surviving the wild realm of programming with C# and PowerShell as my chosen weapons.
I’m not pretending to be a 10x developer — I’m just stubborn enough not to give up when my code decides to go rogue.

My ultimate goal? To build a video game that doesn’t crash (too often).

The legendary ConcernedApe, the lone creator of Stardew Valley, keeps me sane.
If he could build an entire digital village alone, surely I can manage one working script without setting my PC on fire. Probably.
